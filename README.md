# European-Soccer-Trade-Machine

## Project Description
One of the best ways to gain a competitive advantage in professional sports such as soccer is to identify undervalued players that are particularly well suited to the teamâ€™s needs. In this project, we will develop a tool for recommending strong transfers in European soccer leagues, based on factors including teams' financial resources, players' market values, positions, and performance statistics (appearances, goals, position-specific stats, etc.). We intend to utilize a machine learning model to determine the characteristics that are most likely to predict a winning trade. We then plan to implement a CSP algorithm involving constraints regarding team positional and financial needs in order to determine optimal potential transfers. This tool would be of value to general managers and front office staff for making transfer decisions based on factors such as positional needs, financial constraints, and season ambitions.
